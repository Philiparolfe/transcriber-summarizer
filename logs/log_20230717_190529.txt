Summary: Ground-penetrating radar surveys were conducted at McGill University to investigate the presence of bodies on the site of the old Royal Victoria Hospital. This was prompted by the detection of traces of human remains near the former nurses dormitories. The Mohawk mothers, a group of women from Victoria, were known to have been at the hospital.
