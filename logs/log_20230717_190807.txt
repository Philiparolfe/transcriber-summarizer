Summary: Ground-penetrating radar surveys have been conducted on the grounds of McGill University to investigate the presence of bodies at the site of the old Royal Victoria Hospital. This investigation was prompted by the detection of traces of historic human remains near the former nurses' dormitories. The Mohawk mothers, a group of women from Victoria, were discovered within the hospital.
