Summary: Ground-penetrating radar surveys have been conducted on the grounds of McGill University to investigate the presence of bodies at the site of the old Royal Victoria Hospital. This investigation was prompted by the detection of traces of human remains near the former nurses' dormitories by historic human remains dogs. The focus of the search is on the Mohawk mothers, a group of women from Victoria who were associated with the hospital.
